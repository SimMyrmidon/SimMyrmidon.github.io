            I can't even understand myself, so I love myself a lot for that reason. I tend to think carefully and fully about things, but I also have a
             darker side to me, as I'm sure all people do. I've been told that I'm funny, even though I don't really believe I am. But the greatest thing
             a person could know about me is that they will never understand me.</font></p>
